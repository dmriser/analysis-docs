\subsection{Summary}
In this section there will be a table displaying the fractional shift of the result for each systematic error source that was considered in this analysis.  

\subsection{Cut Variations}
In this section we describe the results of cut variations on the analysis. 

\subsection{Random Subset/Helicity}

Two additional studies are performed which involve randomization of the input data in some way.  In the first study, the helicity of each event is assigned a random value of $\pm 1$.  This randomization destroys the correlation between beam spin and the $\phi_h$ distributions.  Therefore, one expects to find zero asymmetries as a result of this randomization.  In the second study, the full analysis is run on a subset of 80% of the events in the full dataset.  This study is designed to identify if there is internal inconsistancy in the dataset.
