\section{Chapter 1: Error Propagation}

Suppose an experiment has measured a set of quantities $\vec{x} = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$ and one wishes to calculate $f(\vec{x})$.  How does the uncertainty on the measured parameters influence the uncertainty on the calculated value of $f$? 

\\
Using the measurements, we can calculate: 

\begin{equation}
	V_{ij} = <x_i x_j> - <x_i><x_j>
\end{equation}
